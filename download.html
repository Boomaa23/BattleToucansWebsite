			<p>This is the download page for DevSushi. If you would like a compiled installer, please use the latest stable build button or grab an earlier version in the archived section. If you would like the most up-to-date download of the game, you can download the source code from our GitHub and compile it yourself. This website's source code is also available on GitHub, if you would like it. All of the installer versions are for Windows 64-bit. If you would like a Linux version, please fill out the form below. If you are having trouble installing the game, or would like a 32-bit version, please contact us through our "Contact Us" page. If you have found a bug, you can report it to the "Bug Reporter" page, which will bring you to the GitHub issue reporter. Thanks!</p><br>
